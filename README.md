These short projects are from the "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp"
on Udemy, this section is for HTML. 

It's funny that this project is close to my birthday(4 days from now, actually!)
This project was easy and took me about 10-15mins (ChatGPT for poem and a then gif search)

It was pretty fun! The only thing I had trouble remembering was the href for the google map
link. I hope that by the end of this bootcamp I can make a really cool website for my 
bithday next year -- Of course it will be spongebob themed!

I know this project seems silly because it's really simple, but progress is progress! :)

What I learned to make this:
Heading elements
paraghraph elements
Void elements
List elements
Anchor elements
Image element
